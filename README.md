# --- What's up ---

I'm Tumbleweed-64, an okay dev who makes some cool things. I used to be into web development a lot, with repos generally consisting of HTML and JavaScript. Now, I've used some non-web languages such as C++, C#, Java, and the like. I've realized that web development kind of sucks. Currently, though, I'm trying to learn Godot and have a game in the works and two ideas that I'll try to make after that, if I'm not too lazy. I have some great projects coming up, so stay tuned for more interesting stuff.

## UPCOMING

- Big update for ClippyEdit, world's greatest text editor with no art direction cause I suck at UI
- Regarding the ClippyEdit update, I will probably rewrite the whole thing in Godot or WPF because WinForms is not a good framework
- Maybe src for a game I'm making with Godot
- Various games and trinkets made with C++, Java, and C#
- And lots more
