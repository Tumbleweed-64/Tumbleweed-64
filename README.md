### --- What's up ---

I'm Tumbleweed-64, an okay dev who makes some cool things. I used to be into web development a lot, with repos using a lot of HTML and JavaScript. Now, I've used some non-web languages such as C++, C#, and some PowerShell/CMD stuff. I've realized that web development kind of sucks. However, I started to come back because I learned a little PHP. Currently, though, I'm learning Godot and have a game in the works and two ideas that I'll make after that. I have some great projects coming up, so stay tuned for more interesting stuff.

# UPCOMING

- Big update for ClippyEdit, world's greatest text editor with no art direction cause I suck at UI
- Regarding the ClippyEdit update, I will probably rewrite the whole thing in Godot because WinForms is terrible fr
- Maybe src for a game I'm making with Godot
- Various games and trinkets made with C++ and C#
- A GH viewer thing I did with PHP and GitHub's API
