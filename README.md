# --- What's up ---

I'm Tumbleweed-64, a fella who makes some cool things. I used to be into web development a lot. Now, I've used some non-web languages such as most C-family languages, Java, and the like. I've realized that web development kind of sucks. Currently, though, I'm trying to learn Unity. I have a game in the works (won't be open source because I need cash) and 2-3 other game ideas that I'll try to make after that, if I'm not too lazy. I have some other great projects coming up that you can read about below, so hopefully I'll do it all (or at least some).

## Upcoming
- Complete rewrite of ClippyEdit in Swing or Unity because WinForms sucks
- Various utilities and trinkets made with C, C++ and Java
- Linux builds of some old projects since I've switched (it's so much better)
- Light hex editor made in good ol' C with `ncurses` (I'm calling it hexed because I couldn't really thing of anything cool for now)
- Terminal-only email system made with C socket API
- Maybe some Unity test projects/plugins
- My github.io site that I've been too busy to write (soon this list will be a blog thing on said site)
- Bash thing that can make some boilerplates for various languages
