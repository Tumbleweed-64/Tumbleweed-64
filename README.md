# --- What's up ---

I'm Tumbleweed-64, a guy who makes some cool things. I used to be into web development a lot. Now, I've used some non-web languages such as most C-family languages, Java, and the like. I've realized that web development sucks. Currently, though, I'm trying to learn Unity. I have a game in the works, (which won't be open source because I need money) as well as another game idea that I'll try to make after that, if I'm not too lazy. I have some other cool projects coming up that you can read about below, so hopefully I'll do it all (or at least some).

## Upcoming
- Complete rewrite of ClippyEdit in Swing or Unity (or SWT maybe) because WinForms sucks
- Various utilities and trinkets made with C, C++ and Java
- Linux builds of some old projects since I've switched
- Light hex editor made in good ol' C with `ncurses`
- Terminal-only email system made with C socket API (CMAIL? TMAIL64? Ehh, I'll think of a name later)
- Maybe some Unity test projects/plugins
- My github.io site that I've been too busy to write as of late (soon this list will be on said site)
