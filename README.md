# --- What's up ---

I'm Tumbleweed-64, a fella who makes some cool things. I used to be into web development a lot. Now, I've used some non-web languages such as C++, C#, Java, and the like. I've realized that web development kind of sucks. Currently, though, I'm trying to learn Godot. I have a game in the works (won't be open source sorry) and two ideas that I'll try to make after that, if I'm not too lazy. I have some other great projects coming up that you can read about below, so hopefully I'll do it all.

## UPCOMING

- Big update for ClippyEdit, world's greatest text editor ever cause I suck at UI
- Regarding the ClippyEdit update, I will probably rewrite the whole thing in Godot or Java Swing because WinForms sucks and I can't get JavaFX to work right
- Maybe src for a game I'm making with Godot
- Various utilitiess and trinkets made with C++ and Java
- Java equivalent of dotnet command line utility if I can get it to work
- Linux builds of some old projects since I've switched (it's so much better)
